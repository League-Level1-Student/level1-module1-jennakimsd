//4. Create a new java class. This will be a "runner" or "driver" class, so it will need a main method.

		//5. In your runner class, create a Duck object (instance) by calling its constructor as follows:



		     // Now you have a duck object, you can make it quack:

		//daffy.quack();

		//6. Now create an instance of your animal (Hint: see step 5 above) and call its methods.
