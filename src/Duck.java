public class Duck {
	//1. Create a Duck class in your java project. Add its member variables and methods to match the CRC card. 
	int numberOfFriends= 0;
	String favoriteFood= "SPAGHETTIIIII";
	//Now add the code for the constructor of the Duck class:

			Duck(String favoriteFood, int numberOfFriends) {
			      	this.favoriteFood = favoriteFood;
			      	this.numberOfFriends = numberOfFriends;
			}

			//2. Now pick your favorite animal and describe it in CRC form with at least 2 member variables and 2 methods (write it on the whiteboard).
